AI Research Internship – Overview & Program

Program Overview
The AI Research Internship is designed for individuals eager to apply AI to real-world business challenges. 
Participants will work on developing an AI-driven solution from end to end—starting from problem understanding, data exploration, model development, and cloud deployment.
This is a highly hands-on program where interns will receive guidance but are expected to take ownership of their research, experimentation, and implementation.
To ensure participants are set up for success, we will conduct a calibration process at the beginning of the internship. This will help us assess their experience and skill level, ensuring they are equipped to tackle the challenges presented.

Internship Objectives
The primary goal is to develop a real AI solution that addresses one of the selected business challenges.
Interns will gain experience in:
Researching and defining AI-driven solutions for real-world problems.
Working with data collection, cleaning, transformation, and modeling.
Implementing machine learning and AI techniques to create functional solutions.
Deploying AI models on cloud infrastructure and integrating them into team projects.

Project Use Cases
Participants will have the flexibility to choose from the following AI-driven business challenges:
SMB Contract Review: Small businesses without legal teams need an AI tool to review contracts, highlight risks, and suggest improvements.
EU Tax Advisory: An AI-driven assistant for individuals with tax obligations across multiple EU countries, providing guidance based on tax laws and obligations.
AI for Public Review Analysis: An AI system that scans online discussions and reviews about businesses, providing summarized insights and potential action points for businesses.

What to Expect
Problem Definition & Guidance: Participants will receive an overview of the challenge, suggested approaches, and relevant tools.
Independent Research & Experimentation: While guidance is available, interns must independently explore documentation, datasets, and ML/AI techniques.
Data Processing & Model Development: Handling data cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, and ML model selection and tuning.
Cloud & Infrastructure Work: Interns should be comfortable working with cloud platforms to deploy and test AI solutions.
Collaboration & Contribution: Engaging with the team, sharing progress, and iterating on feedback.
Commitment & Expectations
Flexibility: Work hours are flexible as long as consistent progress is made.
Proactiveness: A self-driven approach to problem-solving and technical exploration is key.
Hands-on Contribution: Expect to actively code, test, and refine AI models rather than passively learn.
This program is ideal for individuals passionate about AI, eager to work on real-world challenges, experiment with models, and deploy AI solutions in a meaningful way.
